Human-readable identifier generation

The easiest way to generate identifiers that are easy to read, easy to remember and easy to understand if someone gives it to you.

### Basic usage

First require `biohzrdmx/humanids-php` with Composer.

Then you must build a `Generator` instance and to do so you must pass an array of `TokenInterface` implementations, the library includes some common ones to add random adjectives, verbs, animals, numbers, strings, etc.

For example, you can get identifiers in the form `adjective-animal-number[1-100]{3}` with this call:

```php
use Humanids\Generator;
use Humanids\Tokens\AdjectiveToken;
use Humanids\Tokens\AnimalToken;
use Humanids\Tokens\NumberToken;

$tokens = [
    new AdjectiveToken(),
    new AnimalToken(),
    new NumberToken(1, 100, 3),
];
$generator = new Generator($tokens);
$identifier = $generator->generate();
```

Or with this call you'll get identifiers in the form `ec2-adjective-animal-number[1-999]{3}-string{4}`:

```php
use Humanids\Generator;
use Humanids\Tokens\AdjectiveToken;
use Humanids\Tokens\AnimalToken;
use Humanids\Tokens\FixedToken;
use Humanids\Tokens\NumberToken;
use Humanids\Tokens\StringToken;

$tokens = [
    new FixedToken('ec2'),
    new AdjectiveToken(),
    new AnimalToken(),
    new NumberToken(1, 999, 3),
    new StringToken(4, 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'),
];
$generator = new Generator($tokens);
```

You may also create your own `TokenInterface` implementations, for example by extending the `AbstractWordToken` class or by directly implementing the interface`, check the source for any of the generators to get an idea of how they work.
